This is a fork of AE2 i made for trying to solve issues for the [Omnifactory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/omnifactory) modpack.

See [AE2-Omnifactory](https://github.com/PrototypeTrousers/Applied-Energistics-2/tree/AE2-Omnifactory) branch for commits and [Releases](https://github.com/PrototypeTrousers/Applied-Energistics-2/releases) for the compiled jars.

# Applied Energistics 2 (PrototypeTrousers fork for Omnifactory)

## About
A Mod about Matter, Energy and using them to conquer the world.

## RecipeStages
You need to add the following into a CraftTweaker script:
```
mods.recipestages.Recipes.setPackageStage("appeng", allStages);
```

The second argument allows you to customize which stages exactly you want to be craftable with AE2. Idk why would you like to restrict any, but you can.
